In love with programming, kittens and Satoshi Kon movies. 


## Skills:
- Java 8+
- TypeScript / JavaScript (No in-depth knowledge of these languages, I use them only for writing ReactJS applications)
- ReactJS (No in-depth knowledge of the technology, and probably don't know some important aspects. I just use it to write pet projects more quickly and easily)
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web / WebFlux
- Spring Security
- Keycloak
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Cloud
- Hibernate
- Project Reactor / a little bit RxJava
- RabbitMQ (in Spring ecosystem context)
- Docker
- ReduxJS / Redux Toolkit / RTK Query
- PostgreSQL, a little bit MongoDB
- Swagger
- HTML / CSS (Prefer to use ready-made UI libraries and rarely write pure CSS styles)
